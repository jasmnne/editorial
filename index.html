	<h1>Mastering the art of Tea Making</h1>
	<h2>Colombo in a cup</h2>
	<p>He has served tea to the future King of England and Duchess of Cornwall, but those were merely ‘standard’ Teaeli blends like Marzipan Cherry, Strawberry Souffle and an Earl Grey with cornfl ower, bergamot and blood orange. The 23-year-old Sri Lankan founder, Dushyantha De Silva, says his secret weapon is his just-launched bespoke programme, The Blend Master.</p>
	<p>After discussing by telephone or email your palate preferences, the dapper young entrepreneur will arrive at your Colombo hotel suite or beachfront villa along Sri Lanka’s palm-fringed southern coast with his completely natural, high- and low-grown Ceylon green and black teas as well as the premium white varieties of silver and golden-tipped. In Sri Lanka’s post-war era, this gourmet start-up is taking advantage of an emerging niche of tea tourism to caffeinated travellers curious to see where and how their sips originate. This is no standard sip and spit session. Teaeli’s one-on-one sessions are designed to ensure you leave this island paradise with a unique souvenir. An online customization option with international delivery is in the works as well.</p>
	<caption>Ingredients for The Blend Master session include pink peppercorns, cloves and cinnamon</caption>
